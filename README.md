## 📖 What You Will Learn

### 1. Python Basics
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Input/output and string formatting
- Control flow: if, else, loops

### 2. Data Structures
- **Lists:** Creation, indexing, slicing, appending, removing
- **Tuples:** Immutable sequences
- **Sets:** Unique, unordered collections
- **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs, nested dictionaries
- **Compound Structures:** Combining lists, dictionaries, and more

### 3. Practical Coding
- Real-world examples and exercises
- Error handling and debugging
- Best practices and code readability

---

## 📝 Example Topics Covered

- Creating and manipulating sets
- Removing duplicates from data
- Working with nested dictionaries
- Adding and removing elements from data structures
- Using f-strings for readable output
- Handling errors (e.g., KeyError)

---

## 💡 Tips for Beginners

- **Read the comments** in each file—they explain what the code is doing.
- **Try changing values** and running the code to see what happens.
- **Break the code on purpose** to learn how errors work and how to fix them.
- **Google is your friend!** If you don’t understand something, look it up.
